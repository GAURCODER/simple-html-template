### Making your pull request in this repository

**Important note: You'll always have to create your pull request against the develop branch, never against the master one.**

The process of making a pull request can be summarized in the following steps:

- Fork the repository on Github.
- Clone the fork on your computer.
- Configure your basic data in the clone.
- Create a branch from the develop branch.
- Add the files that you want to send as your contribute.
- Tell git which files to track.
- Save changes to git with a commit.
- Synchronize the fork in Github with a push.
- And, pull request to the original repository from Github.

If you want kwnow more details about any one of the steps, check the [extendend tutorial](create-pull-request.md).

If you have any other questions, you can create an [Issue](https://github.com/kevinesaa/simple-html-template/issues/) asking for whatever you want.
